This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It includes a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script to deploy the contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
